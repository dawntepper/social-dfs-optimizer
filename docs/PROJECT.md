# NFL DFS Optimizer Project Documentation

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The NFL DFS Optimizer is a next-generation daily fantasy sports optimization platform that differentiates itself through real-time social sentiment analysis, advanced correlation modeling, and machine learning-driven projections. Unlike traditional optimizers that rely solely on historical data and basic statistics, our platform integrates multiple data streams to provide a more comprehensive analysis of player potential.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Real-time Social Intelligence**
   - Twitter/X and Reddit API integration
   - Beat writer sentiment analysis
   - Automated news impact assessment
   - Trending topic monitoring

2. **Advanced Correlation Analysis**
   - Team-specific correlation matrices
   - Dynamic stack recommendations
   - Game environment impact modeling
   - Weather-adjusted correlations

3. **Modern Tech Stack**
   - Next.js for server-side rendering
   - React for dynamic UI components
   - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - shadcn/ui for consistent UI components

## Technical Implementation

### Why React Over Python
While many DFS optimizers use Python for backend calculations, we've chosen a JavaScript/TypeScript stack for several reasons:

1. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket connections for live updates
   - Immediate UI responses to data changes
   - Seamless integration with social APIs

2. **Client-side Processing**
   - Reduced server load
   - Faster response times
   - Better user experience

3. **Modern Web Features**
   - Progressive Web App capabilities
   - Offline functionality
   - Native app-like experience

### Analysis Generation

#### Social Sentiment Analysis
```typescript
// Example of how sentiment is calculated
const sentiment = {
  twitter: weightedScore * 0.6,
  reddit: weightedScore * 0.3,
  beatWriter: weightedScore * 0.1
};
```

#### Correlation Calculation
- Team-specific correlations based on:
  - Historical performance
  - Game script
  - Weather conditions
  - Vegas lines

#### Projection Adjustments
- Base projections modified by:
  - Social sentiment
  - Weather impact
  - Vegas line movements
  - Beat writer insights
